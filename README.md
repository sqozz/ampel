## Ampel - Version 0.2 aka "now it's almost pretty"
This lovely piece of code is designed to display traffic lights indicating the presence or absence of anything.

It is designed to run on any OS running python3 and a reasonable modern browser. Yes, even Windows is supported
and it runs great under Windows 7!

The main purpose is intended for 2-3 lights indicating the availability of employees.

## Installation
1. `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
2. `source ./venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python3 ampel.py`

## Technical stuff
Ampel is build with python3, flask, html5 with canvas, css3 and also ~~some~~ javascript (at least it does not depend on jqueryâ€¦).

## Hack me
The code is quite flat. Try to hack around with it to suit your needs.
All rendering is as generic as possible while fitting close to my needs.
For example, adding more lights is just a matter of adjusting the CSS and adding a new line to "bearbeiter.txt" - 
that's all, everything else is already done.

PRs are always welcome. Feature requests are getting noticed at least.
